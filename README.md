# PinPoint


- Our friends, family, and significant others approach us with questions on how to spend the day or evening. More often than not we are at a blank with ideas. 
- PinPoint creates random and custom events for all users and purposes! 
- Connecting with new people may be difficult; PinPoint creates a diverse event environment which provides users with chances to make special moments

- We aim to encourage social interactions and engagements to create a vibrant community for our friends and family.
- Our goal is to hone in on an event for our user that will take into account their varying parameters. 
- We also aim to provide the user the option to break free from the mold and create their own events.
